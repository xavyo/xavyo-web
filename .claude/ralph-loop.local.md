for each feature in plan we need to follow speckit process : specify, clarify, plan, tasks,
  implement. using speckit skills ( commands). when you implement you can use agent team. after implementation   
  you MUST make an honest review and fix issues. repeat honest review until issues are gone. during            
  implementation you must also use rust skill. stop loop when all features are done
